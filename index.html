            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Theorists from various fields have tried to define education.Many agree
                that education is a purposeful activity trying to achieve certain aims. These aims include
                the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.However, there are deep disagreements about
                its exact nature besides these general features. According to some theorists, it is
                primarily a process that occurs during events like schooling, teaching, and learning. Others
                understand it not as a process but as the product caused by this process. This means that education is
                what educated persons have. It includes the mental states and dispositions that are characteristic of
                them.The term may also refer to an academic field. This discipline studies the methods and
                processes taking place during teaching and learning. It examines the social institutions involved in
                these processes. The term "education" is derived from the Latin term educare. It means "bring up,
                rear, educate", primarily in relation to the mind. It is also connected to the Latin term educere. It
                means "bring out, lead forth" and refers to the bodily level.Some theorists provide precise definitions
                by giving the exact features that are shared by all forms of
                education and only by them. According to R. S. Peters, for example, education has three essential
                features. It is concerned with the transmission of knowledge and understanding.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex
                institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but happens
                outside the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily
                experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood
                education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus
                on the teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can
                also be distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education.
                Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with
                the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and
                raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of education.
                For example, governments set education policies.Many thick and prescriptive conceptions rely on the aims
                of education to explain their view. This means that they see education as an activity that tries to
                achieve certain aims.These aims can be classified into different categories.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to
                achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that some form of improvement
                took place. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from
                indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The
                term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the
                academic field studying education.Organized institutions play a key role for various aspects of
                education. Institutions like schools, universities, teacher training institutions, and ministries of
                education make up the education sector. They interact both with each other and with other stakeholders,
                such as parents, local communities, and religious groups. Further stakeholders are NGOs, professionals
                in healthcare, law enforcement, media platforms, and political leaders. Many people are directly
                involved in the education sector. They include students, teachers, and school principals as well as
                school nurses and curriculum developers.</p>
